Hi üëã My name is Jaime Veleiro
==============================

Web Developer Student
---------------------

Since I was a kid I've been interested in technology and how my stuff works, starting with video games, transitioning to computer assembly and ending up here, studying web application development. I'm also Lead Organizer of the Google Developer Groups on Campus Malaga, where we bring super interesting events to anyone who is willing to learn more about the technological world.

* üåç¬† I'm based in M√°laga, Espa√±a
* ü§ù¬† I'm open to collaborating on projects where to learn new technologies
* ‚ö°¬† Besides my passion for technology, I am also a handball referee!
